# This is a line from Rstudio
# Hi Professor Moore!
# Thanks for a great semester! This class was very challenging and I definitely learned a ton. I'm very glad I got the chance to delve into some tough coding and programming topics. Right now Rstudio is quite frustrating but I won't let this be the end to my relationship with R. I will continue to practice using this language...the only way to learn is to practice right?! Haha.. Well thanks for everything! I'd love to take another one of your classes in my last year at American. I hope you enjoy your summer and continue to do great things at the Lab!
